Convo Tweet
===

A Twitter conversation app that takes a starting tweet and then tracks
all replies that stem from that tweet. It will include a single
conversation between two people along with group tweets that are held
from three or more people.

Convo Tweet is built on top of socketstream. This is essentially a toy
app to play with socketstream.

Installation instructions for socketstream can be found here (https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream)
